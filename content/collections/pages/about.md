I'm a passionate and versatile Full Stack Developer with over seven years of experience crafting high-quality, user-focused web applications. 

I've worked across fast-paced agencies and product-driven startups, building everything from sleek frontends to robust backend systems.

I specialize in creating modern, responsive user interfaces and delivering smooth, intuitive user experiences using the latest tools and frameworks. Whether working solo or as part of a team, I’m known for consistency, attention to detail, and a strong drive to stay current with evolving web technologies.

I’ve always been curious about how things work. As a kid, I taught myself to build basic websites using whatever tools I could find online, often staying up late trying to fix things I’d broken just to see if I could put them back together. That mix of problem-solving and creativity hooked me early.

Over time, that curiosity grew into a focused passion for software development. I’ve since turned it into a career, building reliable, user-friendly applications across a range of industries. I still get the same satisfaction from writing clean, efficient code that I did back when I was just experimenting on my own — only now, the stakes are a bit higher (and I break things less often).

I’ve worked across agencies and startups, picking up a wide range of skills — from crafting frontends that feel fast and intuitive, to building APIs and infrastructure that can scale. I enjoy taking ownership of the full development cycle, especially when collaborating closely with designers, product teams, and other developers to bring an idea to life in a thoughtful, robust way.

These days, I focus on writing maintainable code, delivering clean interfaces, and staying sharp with the latest tools in the modern web stack. Whether it's shipping a feature or improving an existing flow, I care about the details — and making sure the end result is something I’m proud to put my name to.
